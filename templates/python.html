                <h1>WELCOME TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING!</h1>
		<P>Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.</p>
		<p>Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.</p>
